## Introduction

`Anoy` is a tagging tool built using [python-flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) that enables you to manually tag documents with custom tags and export them as XML documents. This is an ideal tool for a data team who wants to manually tag documents for training a data model.

## Example

Sample document
> Boggarts lavender robes, **Hermione Granger** Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Bee in your bonnet Hand of Glory elder wand, spectacles House Cup Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans Impedimenta. Stunning spells tap-dancing **spider** Slytherin’s Heir mewing kittens Remus Lupin. Palominos scarlet train black robes, Metamorphimagus Niffler dead easy second bedroom. Padma and Parvati Sorting Hat Minister of Magic blue turban remember my last. Let us hit **Accio**.

For training a data model we want to tag few segments of above document with some tags. For example, we want to tag

* `Hermione Granger`  as `PERSON_NAME`
* `spider` as `ANIMAL`
* `Accio` as `SPELL`

You want tagged document to be like
>Boggarts lavender robes, `<PERSON_NAME>Hermione Granger</PERSON_NAME>` Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Bee in your bonnet Hand of Glory elder wand, spectacles House Cup Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans Impedimenta. Stunning spells tap-dancing `<ANIMAL>spider</ANIMAL>` Slytherin’s Heir mewing kittens Remus Lupin. Palominos scarlet train black robes, Metamorphimagus Niffler dead easy second bedroom. Padma and Parvati Sorting Hat Minister of Magic blue turban remember my last. Let us hit `<SPELL>Accio</SPELL>`.

With **Anoy** you can do this with ease. You just need to

1. Define tags `PERSON_NAME` and `ANIMAL`
2. Select text `Hermione Granger` apply tag `PERSON_NAME`
3. Select text `spider` and apply tag `ANIMAL`.
4. Select text `Accio` and apply tag `SPELL`.
5. Export the document
